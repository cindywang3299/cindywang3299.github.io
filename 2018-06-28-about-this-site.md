This post serves primarily as a test post. Feel free to click around to see if there’s a glitch.

This site is built with bootstrap and Jekyll using basic HTML and CSS, and it’s as static as it can be. The building process is actually very easy and smooth - I end up teaching my self a lot during the process.

As I mentioned earlier, I am still thinking of what to write for this website. For now I am just going to focus on other things instead, but I will definitely continue on writing posts and deliver them when I’m ready. Until then, stay hyped!
