<p>Hello, world!</p>

<p>
I am in my second year studying Software Engineering (B.Sc) at McGill University in Montreal, Quebec.

Here you will find a person who adores technology and life, and makes things interesting.

Lately I've been cooking up interesting projects solo and with friends, writing about my fields of interests,
or on my next journey of exploring a new corner of the world... You will see!
